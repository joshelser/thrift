Preconditions (*before* running configure)

export CXXFLAGS='-std=c++11'
gem install rspec thin rack rack-test
brew install boost automake autoconf libtool

Disable the Thrift C (GLib): `./configure --without-c_glib`
    - For GLib, I was getting some errors that I believe were related to missing functions in the glib libs,
        but I couldn't find any help from Google, so I punted. YMMV

If you get more failure while building the Ruby code, you may need to install some extra gems. It should be clear.
Same goes for needing extra libraries to install the C++ bindings -- whatever homebrew provides should be fine.
